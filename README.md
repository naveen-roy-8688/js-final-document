# ✅ JavaScript Core Concepts (Interview Guide)

---

## 1️⃣ Hoisting

### Definition

Hoisting is JavaScript’s behavior of **moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before execution**.

> Only declarations are hoisted, not initializations.

### Example

```js
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;
```

JS internally:

```js
var a;
console.log(a);
a = 10;
```

### Real-time Example

Functions can be called before they appear in the file.

### Interview Answer

> Hoisting is JavaScript’s default behavior where declarations are moved to the top of scope during the compilation phase. Variables declared with `var` are initialized as undefined, while `let` and `const` remain in the temporal dead zone.

---

## 2️⃣ Closures

### Definition

A closure is when a function **remembers variables from its outer scope even after the outer function finishes execution**.

### Example

```js
function counter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function () {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}

const c = counter();
c(); //1
c(); //2
```

### Real-time Example

Used in:

* private variables
* React hooks
* event handlers

### Interview Answer

> A closure is created when an inner function accesses variables from its lexical scope even after the parent function has executed.

---

## 3️⃣ IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

### Definition

A function that runs immediately after it is defined.

### Example

```js
(function () {
  console.log("Runs immediately");
})();
```

### Real-time Example

Avoid polluting global scope in older JS apps.

### Interview Answer

> IIFE is a function executed immediately to create a private scope and avoid global variable conflicts.

---

## 4️⃣ `this` Keyword

### Definition

`this` refers to the **object that is executing the current function**.

### Depends on how function is called:

```js
const user = {
  name: "Adi",
  show() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};
```

### Real-time Example

Used heavily in:

* object methods
* classes
* event handlers

### Interview Answer

> The value of `this` is determined by the invocation context — object method, global scope, constructor, or arrow function.

---

## 5️⃣ Event Loop

### Definition

Mechanism that allows JavaScript (single-threaded) to handle async operations.

### Flow

```
Call Stack → Web APIs → Callback Queue → Event Loop
```

### Example

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("Async"), 0);

console.log("End");
```

Output:

```
Start
End
Async
```

### Interview Answer

> Event loop continuously checks the call stack and moves callbacks from the queue when the stack is empty.

---

## 6️⃣ Higher Order Functions

### Definition

Functions that:

* take another function as argument OR
* return a function.

### Example

```js
arr.map(x => x * 2);
```

### Real-time Example

Array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`).

### Interview Answer

> Higher-order functions improve reusability by operating on functions.

---

## 7️⃣ Type Coercion

### Definition

Automatic or explicit conversion between types.

```js
"5" + 2  // "52"
"5" - 2  // 3
```

### Real-time Example

Form inputs always return strings.

### Interview Answer

> Type coercion is implicit or explicit conversion between data types during operations.

---

## 8️⃣ Currying

### Definition

Transforming a function with multiple arguments into nested functions with single arguments.

```js
function add(a){
  return b => a + b;
}
add(2)(3);
```

### Real-time Example

Reusable configuration functions.

### Interview Answer

> Currying breaks functions into smaller reusable steps.

---

## 9️⃣ call, apply, bind

### Definition

Used to control `this`.

```js
fn.call(obj, a, b);
fn.apply(obj, [a,b]);
const newFn = fn.bind(obj);
```

### Difference

| Method | Executes Immediately | Arguments            |
| ------ | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| call   | ✅                    | comma separated      |
| apply  | ✅                    | array                |
| bind   | ❌                    | returns new function |

### Interview Answer

> These methods explicitly set function context.

---

## 🔟 Memoization

### Definition

Caching function results for faster repeated calls.

```js
const cache = {};
function square(n){
 if(cache[n]) return cache[n];
 return cache[n] = n*n;
}
```

### Real-time Example

API results or expensive calculations.

### Interview Answer

> Memoization optimizes performance by storing previously computed results.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Pure Function

### Definition

Same input → same output, no side effects.

```js
function add(a,b){
  return a+b;
}
```

### Interview Answer

> Pure functions don’t modify external state.

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Side Effect

### Definition

Changing something outside function scope.

```js
let total = 0;
function add(x){
 total += x;
}
```

### Examples

* API calls
* DOM updates
* modifying globals

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Iterators

### Definition

Objects that define sequence using `next()`.

```js
const arr = [1,2];
const it = arr[Symbol.iterator]();
it.next();
```

### Interview Answer

> Iterators allow sequential access to collections.

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Traversing Object

```js
for (let key in obj) {}
Object.keys(obj)
Object.values(obj)
Object.entries(obj)
```

### Interview Tip

Prefer `Object.entries()` for key + value.

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ Important Array Methods

Most asked:

* `map()` → transform
* `filter()` → condition
* `reduce()` → accumulate
* `find()` → first match
* `some()` / `every()`
* `forEach()`
* `slice()` vs `splice()`

---
Interview Definition

map() creates a new array by applying a transformation function to every element of the original array without modifying it.

Example
const nums = [1,2,3];

const doubled = nums.map(n => n * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2,4,6]
Real Use Case

Formatting API data

UI rendering lists (React)

Interview Key Point

✅ Returns new array
✅ Same length as original
✅ Immutable operation

✅ 2. filter() — Conditional Selection
Interview Definition

filter() returns a new array containing only the elements that satisfy a given condition.

Example
const nums = [1,2,3,4];

const even = nums.filter(n => n % 2 === 0);
console.log(even); // [2,4]
Real Use Case

Search results

Removing inactive users

Interview Key Point

✅ Removes elements based on condition
✅ Does not mutate original array

✅ 3. reduce() — Accumulate Values
Interview Definition

reduce() executes a reducer function on each element and accumulates the result into a single output value.

Syntax
array.reduce((accumulator, current) => {}, initialValue)
Example (Sum)
const nums = [1,2,3,4];

const sum = nums.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
console.log(sum); // 10
Real Use Cases

totals

grouping data

object creation

Interview Key Point

✅ Converts array → single value (number/object/array)

✅ 4. find() — First Matching Element
Interview Definition

find() returns the first element that satisfies a condition, otherwise returns undefined.

Example
const users = [
  {id:1},
  {id:2}
];

const user = users.find(u => u.id === 2);
console.log(user); // {id:2}
Interview Key Point

✅ Stops searching after first match
✅ Returns element (not array)

✅ 5. some() — At Least One Match
Interview Definition

some() checks whether at least one element satisfies a condition and returns a boolean.

Example
const nums = [1,3,5,8];

nums.some(n => n % 2 === 0); // true
Use Case

Validation checks.

✅ 6. every() — All Must Match
Interview Definition

every() checks whether all elements satisfy a condition.

Example
const nums = [2,4,6];

nums.every(n => n % 2 === 0); // true
Interview Key Point

Stops early if condition fails.

✅ 7. forEach() — Iteration Only
Interview Definition

forEach() executes a function for each array element but does not return a new array.

Example
const nums = [1,2,3];

nums.forEach(n => console.log(n));
Important Difference

❌ Cannot chain
❌ No return value

Interview Tip

Use forEach for side effects like logging or DOM updates.

✅ 8. slice() vs splice() (VERY COMMON QUESTION)
🔹 slice() — Non-Mutating Copy
Interview Definition

slice() returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array without modifying the original array.

const arr = [1,2,3,4];

arr.slice(1,3); // [2,3]

✅ Original array unchanged.

🔹 splice() — Mutating Method
Interview Definition

splice() adds, removes, or replaces elements by modifying the original array.

const arr = [1,2,3,4];

arr.splice(1,2);
console.log(arr); // [1,4]

✅ Changes original array.

⭐ Quick Comparison Table (Interview Favorite)
Method	Returns	Mutates Array	Purpose
map	new array	❌	transform
filter	new array	❌	condition
reduce	single value	❌	accumulate
find	element	❌	first match
some	boolean	❌	any match
every	boolean	❌	all match
forEach	undefined	❌	iteration
slice	new array	❌	copy part
splice	modified array	✅	add/remove

## 1️⃣6️⃣ Recursion

Function calling itself.

```js
function fact(n){
 if(n===1) return 1;
 return n * fact(n-1);
}
```

### Real-time Example

Tree traversal, folder structures.

---

## 1️⃣7️⃣ Event Binding

Attaching event listener.

```js
button.addEventListener("click", handler);
```

### Interview Answer

> Event binding connects DOM events with JavaScript logic.

---

## 1️⃣8️⃣ Debounce vs Throttle

| Feature   | Debounce          | Throttle       |
| --------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Execution | after delay stops | fixed interval |
| Use case  | search input      | scroll resize  |

### Example

Search box → debounce
Scroll tracking → throttle

---

## 1️⃣9️⃣ Promise

### Definition

Represents future completion of async operation.

States:

* pending
* fulfilled
* rejected

```js
fetch(url)
 .then(res=>res.json())
 .catch(err=>console.log(err));
```

---

## 2️⃣0️⃣ Async / Await

Cleaner promise syntax.

```js
async function load(){
 const res = await fetch(url);
}
```

### Interview Answer

> async/await is syntactic sugar over promises.

---

## 2️⃣1️⃣ Deep vs Shallow Copy

### Shallow

Copies reference.

```js
const b = {...a};
```

### Deep

Copies nested objects.

```js
structuredClone(obj);
```

---

## 2️⃣2️⃣ Mutability vs Immutability

| Mutable          | Immutable        |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Changes original | Creates new copy |
| push()           | concat()         |

Used heavily in React state.

---

## 2️⃣3️⃣ Modules

Split code into reusable files.

```js
export function add(){}
import {add} from './math.js';
```

Benefits:

* maintainability
* reusability
* scope isolation

---

## 2️⃣4️⃣ JavaScript Versions & Futures

Important milestones:

* ES5 → strict mode
* ES6 (2015) → let/const, arrow, classes, modules
* ES7+ → async/await
* Modern → optional chaining, nullish coalescing

Interview Tip:

> ES6 was the biggest upgrade introducing modern JS syntax.

---

## 2️⃣5️⃣ DOM (Document Object Model)

### Definition

Browser representation of HTML as objects.

```js
document.getElementById("id");
```

### Real-time Example

Updating UI dynamically.

### Interview Answer

> DOM is a programming interface allowing JS to read and manipulate HTML structure.

---

# ⭐ How to Answer in Interviews (Golden Rule)

Use this pattern:

👉 **Definition (1 line)**
👉 **Small example**
👉 **Real use case**

Example:

> “Closure is when a function remembers variables from its outer scope even after execution. It’s commonly used for data privacy like counters or React hooks.”
